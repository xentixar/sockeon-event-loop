## Coding Standards

### PHP Standards

- Follow [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding style
- Use type hints and return types wherever possible
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and method names
- Add PHPDoc comments for public methods and classes

### Code Quality

- All code must pass PHPStan level 10 analysis
- All tests must pass
- Code should be maintainable and well-structured

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Run PHPStan
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse

# Run tests
composer test
```

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Use Pest PHP for testing
- Write tests for all new features
- Ensure existing tests continue to pass
- Aim for high code coverage
- Test both success and error cases

### Test Structure

- Unit tests go in `tests/Unit/`
- Feature tests go in `tests/Feature/`
- Test files should be named `*Test.php`

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run tests with coverage
vendor/bin/pest --coverage
```

## Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests when applicable

Example:
```
Add support for libev driver

Implements EvDriver class that uses ext-ev for better performance
in high-concurrency scenarios. Includes automatic driver detection
and fallback to native driver.

Closes #42
